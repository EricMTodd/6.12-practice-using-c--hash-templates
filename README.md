For this assignment you are going to implement a very simple Store interface. The functions and their descriptions are defined in the header file (Store.h). You are to store the inventory(item num and price) into an unordered map defined in the header file and use that map to find and use the prices associated with the item numbers. Your submission will be graded on code structure in addition to the testbench values

You will need the following references to help you with this assignment: https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/unordered_map/unordered_map/unordered_map/ https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/map/map/map/

You may also need to look into fstreams for the file manipulation needed to read in dataList.txt
